# How to contribute

If you like [VectorC2 project](https://vectorc2.kruk.me/) and would like it to grow (faster) - you are by all means welcome to contribute in anyway you see fit.

Here is a couple of ideas:

1. Start using it and [tell us about any (potential problems)](https://github.com/sebastiankruk/VectorC2/issues/new/choose) 
1. Is there some feature(s) missing - [we will be glad to hear about that](https://github.com/sebastiankruk/VectorC2/issues/new/choose) (though at this stage, there might be quite a lot missing)
1. You would like some graphics to be changed and you have an idea how to do that? [Create a pull request with your changes](https://github.com/sebastiankruk/VectorC2/pulls)
1. You are JavaScript, (S)CSS, or Python developer and [would like to fix some bugs or implement some features](https://github.com/sebastiankruk/VectorC2/issues)? Just do it and [submit your changes through a pull request](https://github.com/sebastiankruk/VectorC2/pulls).
1. Did we miss some ideas of contribution? Let us know at vectorc2@kruk.me

Thanks so much for even considering becoming part of this community.
